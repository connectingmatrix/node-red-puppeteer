<p data-type="description-summary">Disconnect from Maya's browser instance</p>

<p>
    All flows that perform browser automation using this module, must end with the Disconnect node.
    If this is not ensured, Maya will keep running the browser process, which will consume system 
    resources unnecessarily.

<h2 data-type="inputs">Inputs</h2>
<p>
    This node has no input properties, but it is triggered only upon receiving a message.
</p>


<h2 data-type="outputs">Outputs</h2>
<p>
    This node does not have any outputs. If the disconnect operation is successful, it simply forwards the message.
